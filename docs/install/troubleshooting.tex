\subsection{If Waf cannot find python lib}

If Waf cannot find the Python lib, i.e. a message ``/usr/bin/ld:
cannot find -lpython'' is obtained after trying to build. A possible
solution is to create a symbolic link to the library in \texttt{/usr/lib/}.
For example, run the command
\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{\$}}] \texttt{sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so.1.0
/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so }\end{description}

\subsection{If library not loaded correctly}

If a library from boost could not be loaded correctly, it is because the dylib 
file could not be found.
%
This may occur even if  `waf configure` passed all tests. 
%
Change your \texttt{DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} if you are using Mac OS X. 
%
Change your \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} if you are using Linux.
%
For example, add export \texttt{DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/path/to/AMD/deps/lib} to 
the end of your .bashrc file.
